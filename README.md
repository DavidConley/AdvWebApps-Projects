# AdvWebApps-Projects
Projects from my Advanced Web Applications course, since I cannot send .zips via email.

All of these were made nearly a year before uploading, so I do not remember all of the exact details of the purposes. They were all for my classwork, though. "Project" is the most complicated, followed by the "Assignment"-labeled ones and then the "Homework"-labeled ones.
